# Credit Card Fraud Detection System Using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of 300,000 anonymized transactions, where fraudulent transactions make up less than 0.1% of the total data. Due to this severe imbalance, special techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) were implemented to improve fraud detection.

### Problem Statement
Traditional fraud detection systems relied on rule-based approaches, which were limited in their adaptability. The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning models to develop an intelligent fraud detection system that can:
âœ” Identify fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall.
âœ” Handle the class imbalance problem effectively.
âœ” Improve scalability and real-time detection capabilities.

### Techniques Used
This project explores various machine learning and deep learning models to compare their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions:

1. Machine Learning Approaches
ðŸ”¹ Random Forest â€“ Ensemble method that improves generalization by training multiple decision trees.
ðŸ”¹ Decision Trees â€“ Simple interpretable model that can capture patterns in the data.

2. Deep Learning Approaches
ðŸ”¹ Neural Networks â€“ Fully connected layers trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

3. Handling Class Imbalance
Since fraud cases are extremely rare, different techniques were implemented to improve the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions:
âœ” SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) â€“ Generates synthetic fraud cases to balance the dataset.
âœ” Class Weight Adjustment â€“ Assigning higher weight to fraudulent transactions in the loss function.
âœ” Under-sampling the Majority Class â€“ Reducing non-fraudulent transactions to balance the dataset.

### Results & Key Findings
ðŸ“Œ The best performance was achieved using SMOTE + Neural Network, which detected 100% of fraud cases while maintaining a low false positive rate.
ðŸ“Œ Random Forest outperformed Decision Trees, showing higher accuracy and better generalization.
ðŸ“Œ Deep Learning models improved performance significantly, especially when trained with weighted loss functions and oversampled data.
